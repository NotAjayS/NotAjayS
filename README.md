## Hi there 👋

I’m Ajay, a passionate software developer and a Computer Science Engineering graduate who enjoys building applications and web solutions that solve real-world problems. I believe in learning by building and constantly pushing myself beyond my comfort zone.

I develop web applications and software systems using technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Java. I focus on writing clean, structured code and creating user-friendly interfaces that are both functional and visually appealing.
